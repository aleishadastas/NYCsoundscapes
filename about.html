         <h1>ABOUT</h1>

        <p>NYC Soundscapes is a collection of audio recordings of ambient sounds from five different locations in all five
             boroughs of New York City. The collection is an account on the relationship between the background or surrounding
              noise present, as well as an analysis of sound frequency and auditory experience in the Big Apple. <br><br>

            <span>How to navigate:</span> <br>
            Hover over the circles on the map illustrated on the homepage, and click on one to access that locationâ€™s
            respective soundscape, information, and data. <br>
            <br>
            <span>Measuring sound frequency:</span> <br>
            With a spectrum analyzer, the soundscapes in this collection are visually represented to compare powers of different sounds at
            each individual frequency. The spectrogram shows the frequencies that make up the sound, from low to high, and how they change,
            from <br>left to right. The power of each frequency increases with time, so the sound becomes louder. With this we can visualize the
            intensity of a sound as it travels through time.
